# bar-chart-project
The bar chart project is an app built using only Html, Css and Jvascript. Title, chart width, height, color, etc. can be changed according to user's needs. This bar chart project was built for the Lighthouse Labs prep course.

# JQuery (new feature learned)
```
<script  src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
//If you want to use a new version of jquery, but you are not sure, 
//put "latest" in the place where you need to put the version, and you can always use the latest version.
```

### Issues && future plan

- The plan was to draw the chart on another page by receiving the user's input from the main page, but could not follow the plan due to lack of time.
- Attempt to draw a line over x axes but fails
- Animation for bar of chart
- Managing tool for user
